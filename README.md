# div
playing around with div functions

## To work with: ##
- k-DPPs
- relative efficiency gap
- multiparty efficiency gap
- coverage functions 


### study the following  ways to evaluate non-proportionality/representation of diverse elements in different partitions:
- Relative Efficiency Gap (multiparty setting, see Nagle15)
- Shannon entropy
- determinantal point processes 
- $L_1$
- $L_2$ difference 
- naive: different ratios of membership 
- submodular diversity-promoting functions 
- running SWAP itself (fixing a few really good partitions)
- Adapt the above evaluation metrics/etc to our setting 
- find smart/baseline ways to partition
- random set partitions (based on random graphs)
- consider refinement of set partitions
- Run hella experiments that examine goodness of different partitions
- propose good combinatorial/heuristic ways to *find* optimal partitions 
-> prove some neat things about that
-quantitatively and qualitatively compare the above approaches
